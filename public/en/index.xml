      <description>Hello, Rmarkdown World! This is the first bolg I wrote by using &amp;ldquo;Blogdown&amp;rdquo; package. As a freshman to writing blogs, I met quite a few problems when I tried to practice following the book of Blogdown. This is due to the lack of R basic knowledge of mine, though I have learned R for serval months.
I hope I can persist in writing blogs with blogdown, besides, I need to continue to learn R knowledge to improve my R skills.</description>
